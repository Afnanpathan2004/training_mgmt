## Current State Analysis

### Database Size
- SQLite database: 1.8GB (substantial data volume)
- Indicates active usage with significant training data

### Code Complexity
- Main views file: 4663 lines (very large, may need refactoring)
- Models: 557 lines (comprehensive data model)
- Multiple assessment and analysis features

### Recent Features
- IDI (Individual Development Index) analysis
- Pre/post assessment improvement tracking
- Advanced Excel file processing
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Potential Areas for Improvement
1. **Code Organization**: Main views file is very large (4663 lines) and could benefit from modularization
2. **Performance**: Large database (1.8GB) may need optimization
3. **Testing**: No visible test files in the current structure
4. **Documentation**: Multiple documentation files exist but may need consolidation
